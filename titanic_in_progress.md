## Project Status Overview
- **Current Stage**: Model Training
- **Progress Summary**: Completed data preprocessing, tried multiple models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), currently tuning hyperparameters.
- **Next Steps**: Test Gradient Boosting model, hyperparameter optimization for best models.
- **Key Decisions**: Chose Random Forest over XGBoost for interpretability, excluded the "date" feature due to lack of impact.

## Data Collection and Acquisition
- **Data Sources**: Data is coming from a public API, supplemented by a Kaggle dataset.
- **Challenges**: API rate limits are causing delays in real-time data collection.
- **Data Quality**: Missing values found in "age" column — will use median imputation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Completed Tasks**: Visualized correlations, detected outliers in age and income columns.
- **Challenges**: Need to explore the relationship between income and target variable.
- **Pending Tasks**: Plot feature distributions to check skewness, perform PCA.

## Feature Engineering
- **Completed Tasks**: Scaled continuous features, encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
- **Challenges**: Deciding whether to use standardization or normalization.
- **Pending Tasks**: Test feature importance and eliminate low-impact features.

## Modeling Progress
- **Models Tested**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-Score, AUC.
- **Challenges**: Random Forest is overfitting slightly, but performs well on test data.
- **Next Steps**: Try Neural Network, experiment with regularization.

## Model Results
- **Model Performance**: Random Forest: 85% accuracy, F1-Score: 0.82.
- **Challenges**: Model overfitting — tuning hyperparameters.
- **Next Steps**: Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

## Deployment Progress
- **Current Status**: Deployed the initial version of the model via a Flask API.
- **Challenges**: API latency is too high, need to optimize model response time.
- **Next Steps**: Work on reducing latency, integrate with the front-end.

## Reproducibility
- **Current Setup**: Docker container created, dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Challenges**: Data preprocessing steps are not fully automated.
- **Next Steps**: Automate data pipeline, improve Docker image.

## Documentation
- **Current Status**: Started with EDA and data processing sections.
- **Challenges**: Need to better document model decisions and parameter choices.
- **Next Steps**: Document results and deployment steps.

## Risks and Challenges
- **Known Risks**: Data quality issues, potential overfitting on the model.
- **Mitigation Plans**: Regular validation of data pipeline, apply early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Collaboration and Communication
- **Team Updates**: Weekly sync-ups with the data science team.
- **Next Check-In**: Next meeting on Friday, discuss model tuning results.
