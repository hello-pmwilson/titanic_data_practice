## Project Overview

- **Title**: Titanic - Remember How to Data Science - Passenger Survivorship
- **Summary**: This project will analyze the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using basic/introductory datascience techniques and along the way build up some personal documentation and habits. It includes:
  - Good documentation practice
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training 
    - Logisitc Regression 
    - Random Forest
  - Basic evaluation
    - Accuracy
- **Problem Statement**: The goal of the project is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. The provided dataset contains various features, demographic and social details. By analyzing the features, I aim to provide insight into key factors influecing survival chances. 
- **Goals/Objectives**:
  - **Predict** the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning
  - **Identify** key factors influecning survival
  - **Document** the process to build good habits
